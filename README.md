# master
main repository

1. The main code of the project lies in main.py, and in order to run it must be in a Python 3.11 or higher environment with the right Kivy tools downloaded with the pip command. The architecture of the project must match with the folders in a necessary heirarchy. Many of the files are placeholders right now that are generated when the code is ran, such as screens/main.kv, and any TEMP.txt file only exists because Github doesn't allow for empty folders.
2. One the Python environment is setup in the VS terminal, the main.py code can be ran and will generate the necessary files, and should write them on your machine as needed. This current iteration is a simple box that exists to give a skeleton to be expanded upon.

   NEXT GOALS: main menu, login system SQLite, login screen, profile page
